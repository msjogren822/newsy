It's really barebones and a work in progress. The only reason I made it is because I got so used to using Ahmed Abdelsalam's(https://wb.gy/) https://github.com/geeksamu/angular-5-article-series demo with Angular for genuine news reading purposes. When my clone of his git stopped functioning about a month ago(today is 6/14/20) or so I realized his did too. It is some JS package dependency I bet and I can't troubleshoot JS like I can PHP.

I was kind of interested in learning a bit about Angular but it is not easy for me to move away from simple PHP and Javascript. With Angular, this took a lot of extra work that had to do with setting up the environment. With PHP, you can evade a lot of that. I wrote it directly into a blank new PHP file created on a shared unix server running cPanel. No dev environment whatsoever.

I like Git, Github and the whole Gitty mess but I did notice 1 thing. I couldn't make a section of the code private, it is all or nothing so the api key section is broken to hide my api key. In my opinion, in the time it took Microsoft to assimilate Github, that functionality should be available already. I can't imagine how many projects there are out there that could share out sections.
